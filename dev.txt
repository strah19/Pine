6/14/2021 ~Beta Pine V 0.01~
-----------------------------
*   | Created this initial file, sort of like a first commit. Was able to refactor all the expression code (got rid of shunt yard) and
    | started to investigate into possible lexer optimizations. Around 95% of current compile time (which is just lexing and parsing) 
    | is from the lexer. Possibly due to too many malloc calls or some sort of expensive string operation.
BUG | Could be a possible memory leak form the ASTNodes. Freeing children nodes causes segment faults (Investigate). 
    | 
    | Added a benchmarking tester into 'pine.h'. 
    |
*   | Added more language specific error handlers into the language such as redefination of variables. More these need to be added in
    | upcoming weeks.

-----------------------------
TD  | Work on the bytecode builder. Taking the AST Tree after a single parse statement and convert and store it as byte code in the 
    | bytecode_builder file. Then, after the entire program has been parsed, run the bytecode in the virtual machine.
TD  | Need to create a register system for the vm. Also have a stack and instruction pointer. All this can be stored directly in the 
    | bytecode_builder file instead of having a bytecode_builder struct.
TD  | Kind of a bug, make a system for symbols that can have different types. This can be done most likely with unions. Possibly make it 
    | so that the symbol struct doesn't actual store the data but instead have an allocation pool of all the variables and each symbol
    | stores a pointer and size so it can poke into the pool. 
GP  | Pushed to github at 13:58, did this to save any work from yesterday before modification.
    |
TD  | Get rid of huge switch statement in 'expression.h', instead store the precedence values for different operators in an array. | IGNORE FOR NOW |
    |
    | Fixed error from parser. Forgot to take out unused code from last push.
